## Engine Setup Parameters

This section outlines the fundamental setup parameters for the SI engine, including engine type, number of cylinders, displacement, RPM, and compression ratio. Users can adjust these parameters to analyze different engine configurations.

## Air and Fuel Specific Values

Here, the specific values related to air and fuel properties are listed, such as gas constants, specific heat capacities, and fuel heating values. These values are crucial for accurate thermodynamic calculations within the engine model.

## Engine Geometrical Parameters

Here, the geometrical parameters of the engine, including bore size, stroke length, and clearance volume per cylinder are listed. These parameters influence the engine's physical characteristics and performance metrics.

## Note on Usage

This design is intended for SI engine analysis. You can check parameter values and constants before making modifications. All formulas for state and resultant analysis have been pre-configured in the Excel file. Only modify the setup parameters and constants if necessary as per your engine requirements.
